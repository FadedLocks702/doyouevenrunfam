					<h3><b>Malibu Half Marathon 2013</b></h3>
					<h5>Malibu, CA; November 10, 2013</h5>
					<p>Small anecdote about my very fist half marathon.  Only thing I can say shit was hilly.  </p>
				</section>

				<section id="laMar-01">
					<img src="images/lamarathon2014-medal.jpg">
					<h3><b>The Asics LA Marathon</b></h3>
					<h5>Los Angeles, CA; March 9, 2014</h5>
					<p>My first 26.2 miler ever.  Done on the anniversary of Biggie's passing so you can imagine what I was bumping after mile 6.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="hollyHf-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>Hollywood Half Marathon</b></h3>
					<h5>Hollywood, CA; April 5, 2015</h5>
					<p>Body felt great just after the LA Marathon.  Great followup fa sho.</p>
				</section>	

				<section id="sBar-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>The Santa Barbara Marathon</b></h3>
					<h5>Santa Barbara; November 8, 2014</h5>
					<p>One of the more scenic runs I've done so far.  I also had my first experience with the wall and suffered a calf pull halfway through.  Towards the finish line I started questioning why I put myself through this.  It was also hot, for a friggin fall month.</p>
				</section>	

				<section id="bWorld-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>Better World Running Half Marathon</b></h3>
					<h5>January 4, 2015; Santa Monica Boardwalk</h5>
					<p>After Sangta Barbara I started eating right.  I micromanaged my macros and started to lose weight.  This is a small run but a great cheap warmup of getting that race feeling since we tend to run differently when with a big group.</p>
				</section>	

				<section id="laMar-02">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>The Last Asics LA Marathon</b></h3>
					<h5>Los Angeles, CA; March 15, 2015</h5>
					<p>Second LA Marathon and much more ready prepared.  Even dropped 10ish pounds from Santa Barbara for this.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="oC-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>The US Bank OC Marathon (Half)</b></h3>
					<h5>Costa Mesa, CA; May 3, 2015</h5>
					<p>Only thing I remembered from this race that it was pretty cloudy - perfect for running. This is the first of 3 challenges for the Beach Cities Series.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="sFran-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>The San Francisco Marathon
					</b></h3>
					<h5>San Francisco, CA; July 26, 2015</h5>
					<p>By far my favorite race.  Great contrast of scenery from Embardero, to Golden Gate Park to Haight Ashbury.  I should have PR'D but I had to Pee before crossing the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="smClass-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>The Santa Monica Classic (10k)
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Santa Monica, CA; September 13, 2015</h5>
					<p>This is only a 10k, and its one of SM's longest running short distance races.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="lbeach-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>Jet Blue Long Beach Marathon
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Long Beach, CA; October 11, 2015</h5>
					<p>The second of the beach city series.  I registered out of peer pressure and by far it was probably one of my worst.  I slammed into the wall once again and it was a hundred degrees when I crossed the finish line.  Did I mention I had bloody nipples in this race too?</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="sac-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>California International Marathon
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Sacramento, CA; December 3, 2015</h5>
					<p>Boston Qualification became part of my consciousness when I ran this race, because this is one of the more popular races to qualify for the Boston Marathon.  #1 - its a gradual downhill course.  #2 - its a winter race.  It was my first race in the rain and I never had a better PR since.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="surfCity-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>Surf City Marathon
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Huntington Beach, CA; February 7, 2016</h5>
					<p>The last of the Beach City series.  Marathon felt too loopy.  The race is also the start of the decline of my body from doing so many in the previous year.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="hollyHf-02">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>Hollywood Half Marathon
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Hollywood, CA; April 9, 2016</h5>
					<p>Revisted this race to join a buddy doing his first half.  It was pretty rain this go around.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="smClass-02">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>Santa Monica Classic
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Santa Monica, CA; September 11, 2016</h5>
					<p>This became the first challenge in the Inaugural Conqur series.  Weather was a little better this year.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="Passa-01">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>
					</b></h3>
					<h5>Pasadena, CA; January 22, 2017</h5>
					<p>Challenge #2 on the conqur series, ran on probably the rainest day in 2017.</p>
				</section>	

				
				<section id="laMar-03">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>
					Sketchers Performance LA Marathon</b></h3>
					<h5>Los Angeles, CA; March 19, 2017</h5>
					<p>Challenge #3 of the Conqur series.  3rd LA Marathon but 1st one I ran sponsored by Skechers.  At this point I felt like I started over.  Injuries are a B!</p>
				</section>	
				
				<section id="sFran-02">
					<img src="#">
					<h3><b>The San Francisco Marathon (2nd Half)
					</b></h3>
					<h5>San Francisco, CA; July 23rd, 2017</h5>
					<p>Ran the half this time.  There are two versions of the half, and the second half that I ran consist of Golden Gate Park to the finish at Embarcadero.</p>
